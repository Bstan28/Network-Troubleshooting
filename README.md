# Network-Troubleshooting
Scripts that I've developed to help with network diagnostics and troubleshooting.

# Reverse-DNS-Resolver.py
Script parses all of the IPs out of a string. Then iterates through each IP to find all of the FQDNs for the corresponding IP.

# ping-sweep.py
Script parses all of the IPs out a string. Then attempts to ping each IP. The script will print out whether the host was reachable or not.
